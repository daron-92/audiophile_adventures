      <h3>Leben CS-300XS</h3>
      <p>
        I was in the market for a new amplifier, leaning towards the sound of Audio Note, Shindo, and Line Magnetic, when my local dealer started selling Leben Audio equipment. According to forums, people with a history like mine gravitated towards Leben's sound, so I was intrigued. Leben Audio is another small workshop with a mastermind at its center, Taku Hyodo-san. The products are handmade and driven by a love of audio rather than financial interests. Deciding to buy a Leben amplifier took me a long time. It was very expensive and impossible to find used pieces. It was also suspicious that the shop said it was unavailable for a listening session even though they had a demo unit. Nevertheless, I ended up buying the only piece they had. Leben amplifiers are made on demand, so if I waited, it would be three months for a new one. Out of the box, the sound was bad. Despite being warned that it needed proper burn-in, I couldn't help but worry that I had made the wrong choice. It took approximately 600 hours for the Leben to open up. After the harshness and lack of bass subsided, it provided the best sound I had ever heard. I experimented with tube rolling since the stock tubes were cheap Sovteks. Unfortunately, I was unlucky with PSVANE tubes; I tried two different sets, but both were microphonic. I ended up sticking with the Sovteks, and the sound was still beautiful. It had the right tonal character, adequate bass response, detailed mids, and a sweet upper range. I believe this is the final destination for me for a long time. The journey to find the perfect amplifier has been long and filled with many lessons, but with the Leben, I feel I have finally found the sound I have been searching for.

      <h3>Line Magnetic LM-217ia</h3>
      <p>
        When I saw the Line Magnetic LM-217ia amplifier on a buy-sale forum, I instantly knew I had to try it. This single-ended 300B construction, capable of 8 watts, promised a new experience in every way. It traveled across continents, arriving from Sweden just before the borders closed due to COVID-19. Compared to the tiny 47 Laboratory amplifier, this device was a tank: a substantial unit weighing 20 kilograms, built to last a century. While I liked it, it gave me hard times during cleaning and maintenance. The amplifier arrived with stock tubes, probably Shuguang, and sounded a bit thin and lifeless. I upgraded to the PSVANE TII series (grey bottle) along with matching preamp tubes. The whole set cost as much as the amplifier itself, but it was worth it—the sound quality improved dramatically to high-end levels. I appreciated the tone and the boldness of its bass, but it lacked the attacks I looked for in rock and electronic music. Turning up the volume caused the sound to collapse. These critiques were pointed out by my new amp, so I wasn’t aware of them while listening; I just felt something was missing compared to the 47 Labs. Despite this, I still enjoyed the music, though it didn’t touch my heart in the same way. Instead, I started to focus on the details, which the Line Magnetic delivered beautifully. It’s interesting how a system’s abilities can change how you listen to music. However, deep down, I knew I had to move on. The quest for the perfect sound continued, driven by a desire to find an amplifier that could combine both emotional connection and detailed listening.

      <h3>47 Laboratory 4736</h3>
      <p>
        It was a rare opportunity when I saw a 47 Laboratory 4736 integrated amplifier on eBay at a very low price from the UK. I decided to act fast and buy it, despite a bit of fear that it might be a scam. However, the seller turned out to be a nice and honest man. One and a half weeks later, I opened the package and found my dream equipment inside. 47 Laboratory is not your typical consumer electronics brand; it's the product of an audio enthusiast's little workshop. This upgrade moved my system from basic HiFi to an audiophile listening experience. The pride of ownership was definitely there—the little midnight blue box was something special. I used the 47 Laboratory 4736 with a pair of KEF LS50 speakers, and I remember just listening to music and smiling. It had a certain magic, and this combo would satisfy anyone, I guess. However, my curiosity got the better of me, and the logical next step was to explore the world of tube amplifiers. After two happy years together, the 47 Laboratory had to go to fund a new amp. There are few things I regret selling, and this amplifier is one of them. But sometimes, there's no other way to afford a new piece of equipment. This experience taught me the value of rare finds and the joy of truly exceptional audio equipment.

        <h3>Cambridge Audio CXA60</h3>
        <p>
          I settled with the Denon PMA-495R for a long time—not because I wasn’t curious about other equipment, but as a student, this hobby was far too expensive. My situation improved as a university student, and after winning a grant for my research, I was finally able to move on. I sold the Denon at a marketplace and began searching for alternatives. Cambridge Audio, another mainstream brand, caught my attention. I have to admit, their new line of products was pretty attractive, and the reviews (probably paid, though) were positive. In 2017, I decided to buy the new CXA60. One of its biggest advantages for me was the integrated DAC. At that time, I couldn't afford a separate unit, so this feature made my life easier. I paired the CXA60 with a pair of DALI Zensor 1 speakers, and the upgrade in sound quality was quite significant compared to the Denon, especially in the bass department. The bass was broader and more vivid, an area where I felt the Denon lacked power. The Cambridge was stronger and delivered a more satisfying low-end response. Overall, the Cambridge Audio CXA60 was a very nice unit. I would say that if someone is just interested in good specs within the HiFi range, they could be quite happy with it. It marked a significant step up in my audio journey and allowed me to appreciate the nuances and depth that better equipment can bring to music.

        <h3>Denon PMA-495R</h3>
        <p>
          My journey into the world of high-fidelity audio began with the Denon PMA-495R, a gift from my mother for my 12th birthday. At that time, I wasn’t deeply immersed in the hobby and was mostly familiar with mainstream brands like Onkyo, Denon, Marantz, and Cambridge Audio. While these brands have rich histories, they are now largely owned by big corporations focused on profit rather than the love of music. When choosing the ideal amplifier for my system, I had two main criteria: specifications and aesthetics. I visited my local shop, looking for the device with the lowest Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and the Denon PMA-495R stood out among their offerings. It was the cheapest model from Denon, priced at 55,000 HUF, which was a significant expense for our family at the time. Despite its entry-level status, I was thrilled when I received it and it served me well for many years. In terms of sound, it was thin and cold. I hesitate to call it "analytic" because some details were missing; "technical" might be a more accurate description. It was a good everyday driver and, considering it was the bottom of the line, it performed admirably. I even brought it to a house party once, where it unfortunately got damaged. Despite this setback, I stuck with the Denon PMA-495R, and it continued to serve me for over a decade. It taught me valuable lessons about HiFi and provided a solid foundation for my audio journey. It wasn’t the best amplifier out there, but it was a decent beginning for a young enthusiast. Looking back, I appreciate the Denon PMA-495R for what it was: a reliable entry-level amplifier that sparked my lifelong passion for high-fidelity audio.
