        <h3>Cambridge Audio CX60</h3>
        <p>
          I settled with the Denon PMA-495R for a long time—not because I wasn’t curious about other equipment, but as a student, this hobby was far too expensive. My situation improved as a university student, and after winning a grant for my research, I was finally able to move on. I sold the Denon at a marketplace and began searching for alternatives. Cambridge Audio, another mainstream brand, caught my attention. I have to admit, their new line of products was pretty attractive, and the reviews (probably paid, though) were positive. In 2017, I decided to buy the new CX60. One of its biggest advantages for me was the integrated DAC. At that time, I couldn't afford a separate unit, so this feature made my life easier. I paired the CX60 with a pair of DALI Zensor 1 speakers, and the upgrade in sound quality was quite significant compared to the Denon, especially in the bass department. The bass was broader and more vivid, an area where I felt the Denon lacked power. The Cambridge was stronger and delivered a more satisfying low-end response. Overall, the Cambridge Audio CX60 was a very nice unit. I would say that if someone is just interested in good specs within the HiFi range, they could be quite happy with it. It marked a significant step up in my audio journey and allowed me to appreciate the nuances and depth that better equipment can bring to music.

        <h3>Denon PMA-495R</h3>
        <p>
          My journey into the world of high-fidelity audio began with the Denon PMA-495R, a gift from my mother for my 12th birthday. At that time, I wasn’t deeply immersed in the hobby and was mostly familiar with mainstream brands like Onkyo, Denon, Marantz, and Cambridge Audio. While these brands have rich histories, they are now largely owned by big corporations focused on profit rather than the love of music. When choosing the ideal amplifier for my system, I had two main criteria: specifications and aesthetics. I visited my local shop, looking for the device with the lowest Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and the Denon PMA-495R stood out among their offerings. It was the cheapest model from Denon, priced at 55,000 HUF, which was a significant expense for our family at the time. Despite its entry-level status, I was thrilled when I received it and it served me well for many years. In terms of sound, it was thin and cold. I hesitate to call it "analytic" because some details were missing; "technical" might be a more accurate description. It was a good everyday driver and, considering it was the bottom of the line, it performed admirably. I even brought it to a house party once, where it unfortunately got damaged. Despite this setback, I stuck with the Denon PMA-495R, and it continued to serve me for over a decade. It taught me valuable lessons about HiFi and provided a solid foundation for my audio journey. It wasn’t the best amplifier out there, but it was a decent beginning for a young enthusiast. Looking back, I appreciate the Denon PMA-495R for what it was: a reliable entry-level amplifier that sparked my lifelong passion for high-fidelity audio.
