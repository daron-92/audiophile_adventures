        <h3>Denon PMA-495R</h3>
        <p>
          My journey into the world of high-fidelity audio began with the Denon PMA-495R, a gift from my mother for my 12th birthday. At that time, I wasn’t deeply immersed in the hobby and was mostly familiar with mainstream brands like Onkyo, Denon, Marantz, and Cambridge Audio. While these brands have rich histories, they are now largely owned by big corporations focused on profit rather than the love of music. When choosing the ideal amplifier for my system, I had two main criteria: specifications and aesthetics. I visited my local shop, looking for the device with the lowest Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and the Denon PMA-495R stood out among their offerings. It was the cheapest model from Denon, priced at 55,000 HUF, which was a significant expense for our family at the time. Despite its entry-level status, I was thrilled when I received it and it served me well for many years. In terms of sound, it was thin and cold. I hesitate to call it "analytic" because some details were missing; "technical" might be a more accurate description. It was a good everyday driver and, considering it was the bottom of the line, it performed admirably. I even brought it to a house party once, where it unfortunately got damaged. Despite this setback, I stuck with the Denon PMA-495R, and it continued to serve me for over a decade. It taught me valuable lessons about HiFi and provided a solid foundation for my audio journey. It wasn’t the best amplifier out there, but it was a decent beginning for a young enthusiast. Looking back, I appreciate the Denon PMA-495R for what it was: a reliable entry-level amplifier that sparked my lifelong passion for high-fidelity audio.
