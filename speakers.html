        <h3>Klipsch RP600M</h3>
        <p>
          It was never meant to be a permanent solution, but while I settled on some decent high-end speakers for my tube amplifier, I thought it would be interesting to try something new. So, I bought a Klipsch RP-600M. This model has a sensitivity of 94dB, which should be taken with a grain of salt but is still relatively easy to drive with a single-ended triode (SET) amp. Klipsch was one of my childhood dreams. Back then, I was impressed by its brass-colored drivers that looked awesome. However, by the time I had the money to buy one, I had moved beyond its level. Don't get me wrong—Klipsch makes nice speakers, but they are mainly for home theater, and their musical capabilities are average. At this stage, I wanted more "exotic" stuff, not mainstream consumer products you can buy from the nearest electronics store. Ironically, due to COVID-19, I had to wait two months for this speaker, which made me quite excited in the meantime. It was an interesting experience indeed. The Klipsch does things differently. It produces a very analytical sound where you can hear every detail, but instruments certainly don't have a "real" sound. Everything came across as very artificial in a metallic kind of way. Fortunately, the Klipsch was a good match with the Line Magnetic, so the sound was balanced. However, I can imagine this combination could easily become irritating with a solid-state amp. I am glad I tried this combo, as it taught me something important about sound: tonal character is more significant than fine details. The Klipsch RP-600M offered an intriguing lesson in the nuances of audio, helping refine my understanding and preferences as I continued my audiophile journey.

        <h3>KEF LS50</h3>
        <p>
          The real step up came when I bought myself a KEF LS50 for Christmas. This was a true audiophile speaker with a surprisingly good bass response despite the small size of the box. I still vividly remember my surprise when I first heard some familiar music through it. Instead of the metallic, cold clinging that my DALI provided, the KEF had a beautiful midrange and upper range. To complete the setup, I ordered a matching stand from England. Not only did the KEF LS50 sound amazing, but it was also pleasing to look at. Paired with my 47 Laboratory amplifier, this speaker provided one of the best listening experiences I’ve ever had. I hesitated to sell it, but I convinced myself that it wouldn't be suitable for my Line Magnetic 300B amplifier due to its weaker sensitivity (for an 8-watt amplifier, you ideally want at least 90dB). As a result, the KEF LS50 had to go. In hindsight, I regret never trying it with the Line Magnetic amplifier; perhaps it wouldn’t have been such a bad match after all. HiFi is a continuous journey for me, so at some point, I had to move on. The KEF LS50 was a significant milestone in my audio journey, offering a taste of high-end sound and setting a high bar for future upgrades.

        <h3>Dali Zensor 1</h3>
        <p>
          After the fiasco with my second DIY speaker, I felt it was time to move on to proper, commercially available speakers. I decided on DALI's entry-level bookshelf speaker, the Zensor 1. It was also a very small box, and, as far as I can remember, the sound wasn't substantially better than the DIY speaker made by György Révész. Nevertheless, I used the Zensor 1 for a long time. Once, I burnt out its bass driver, but fortunately, it was repaired for free at the service center. While it was nothing special, it was a good generalist speaker that did its job while I focused more on the electronics. Switching speakers has always been challenging for me because I don’t have a car, making logistics quite difficult. Despite these hurdles, the DALI Zensor 1 served me well during this phase of my audio journey, providing reliable performance as I continued to explore and upgrade other components of my system.

        <h3>R.Gy. Acoustics DIY</h3>
        <p>
          My second speaker was also a DIY project, but this time it was crafted by a real pro. György Révész, also known as "HiFi Gyuri," made a tiny little box that delivered a big sound. The woodwork was exceptional, making it a pleasure to look at—you wouldn’t guess it was a hobbyist's product. The speaker used an S.A.L. tweeter from the upper range of the manufacturer. These tweeters were hard to get because they were primarily sold to companies as OEM parts, and it turned out this was its weak point. The bass driver was a modified Chinese unit. Together, these components delivered good sound and could fill a big room with music. Unfortunately, the tweeter sustained physical damage; its cone was pushed in and it was beyond repair. I couldn't get my hands on a replacement part, and I was quite sad about it. Because of this, the whole speaker had to go. Despite this setback, this speaker marked a significant step up in my audio journey, showing me what a well-crafted DIY project could achieve and deepening my appreciation for high-quality sound and craftsmanship.

        <h3>The DIY M.N.C. Box</h3>
        <p>
          My first real loudspeaker (i.e., not an active one) was a custom-built piece made by my classmate's uncle. It was constructed with M.N.C. kevlar membrane car hi-fi bass/midrange drivers and S.A.L. tweeters in a bass reflex box. One of the drivers was faulty, so I had to replace it, but these were cheap units, so it was manageable. There's not much to say about the sound quality, as it was quite poor. It produced some sounds that were vaguely similar to the music I intended to play. Despite this, it wasn't a bad start—I was happy with it and used these speakers for a year. When I eventually moved on to better equipment, I just gave them back to my classmate. These speakers may not have offered high-fidelity sound, but they marked the beginning of my journey into the world of audio. They taught me the basics of speaker setup and gave me a starting point from which to improve. Every audiophile has to start somewhere, and for me, this custom build was the humble beginning of a lifelong passion.
