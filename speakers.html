        <h3>R.Gy. Acoustics DIY</h3>
        <p>
          My second speaker was also a DIY project, but this time it was crafted by a real pro. György Révész, also known as "HiFi Gyuri," made a tiny little box that delivered a big sound. The woodwork was exceptional, making it a pleasure to look at—you wouldn’t guess it was a hobbyist's product. The speaker used an S.A.L. tweeter from the upper range of the manufacturer. These tweeters were hard to get because they were primarily sold to companies as OEM parts, and it turned out this was its weak point. The bass driver was a modified Chinese unit. Together, these components delivered good sound and could fill a big room with music. Unfortunately, the tweeter sustained physical damage; its cone was pushed in and it was beyond repair. I couldn't get my hands on a replacement part, and I was quite sad about it. Because of this, the whole speaker had to go. Despite this setback, this speaker marked a significant step up in my audio journey, showing me what a well-crafted DIY project could achieve and deepening my appreciation for high-quality sound and craftsmanship.

        <h3>The DIY M.N.C. Box</h3>
        <p>
          My first real loudspeaker (i.e., not an active one) was a custom-built piece made by my classmate's uncle. It was constructed with M.N.C. kevlar membrane car hi-fi bass/midrange drivers and S.A.L. tweeters in a bass reflex box. One of the drivers was faulty, so I had to replace it, but these were cheap units, so it was manageable. There's not much to say about the sound quality, as it was quite poor. It produced some sounds that were vaguely similar to the music I intended to play. Despite this, it wasn't a bad start—I was happy with it and used these speakers for a year. When I eventually moved on to better equipment, I just gave them back to my classmate. These speakers may not have offered high-fidelity sound, but they marked the beginning of my journey into the world of audio. They taught me the basics of speaker setup and gave me a starting point from which to improve. Every audiophile has to start somewhere, and for me, this custom build was the humble beginning of a lifelong passion.
