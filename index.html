        Hi! I am an audio enthusiast since I was 13 years old, and I have tried some equipment until now. I always wanted to categorize my experiences in HiFi, because I think it would help me further to reflect on them. I try to list every piece of equipment that I tried, and write a short review of it, also include some technical data. It may even be interesting for other like-minded individuals.
