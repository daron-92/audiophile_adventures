        <h3>HiDiamond Series 3 Cables</h3>
        <p>
          Even though my 47 Labs OTA cables had impressed me, the quest for even better sound led me to experiment with the HiDiamond cables. These cables, particularly the mid-tier 3 series, came with a hefty price tag compared to the 47 Labs, and I decided to go all-in by replacing every cable in my system with HiDiamond. The total investment was substantial, costing around 600,000 HUF. However, the results were disappointing. Despite the high expectations that come with such an investment, the sound quality was actually slightly worse than what I had achieved with the much cheaper 47 Labs cables. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: in the world of audio, more expensive doesn't always mean better. It was a reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions can offer the best results, and that chasing higher price tags doesn't guarantee an improvement in sound quality.

        <h3>Pro-Ject DAC Box USB</h3>
        <p>
          After using the NAD Wireless USB DAC 2 for a while, I started to become increasingly concerned about the potential compromises in sound quality that wireless audio might introduce. It seemed like the right time to switch to a wired connection, aiming for a more reliable and potentially higher-quality listening experience. I decided on the Pro-Ject DAC Box USB, which was priced similarly to the NAD Wireless DAC but offered the benefits of a wired setup. The build quality of the Pro-Ject was impressive—sturdy, with a thick, heavy box that gave it a reassuring feel of durability and quality. As for the sound quality, my memory is a bit hazy, but given that it was an entry-level model, I’d say it performed its role adequately. It wasn’t a standout in any particular way, but it provided the dependable performance I was looking for at the time. The Pro-Ject DAC Box USB marked a practical step forward in my audio journey, offering a solid and stable platform for my digital music, without the potential pitfalls of wireless transmission.

        <h3>NAD Wireless DAC 2</h3>
        <p>
          After reorganizing my room and placing my hi-fi system on a separate wall from my laptop—which served as my main digital front end—I encountered a practical issue. There was a five-meter gap between my amplifier and the source, making it inconvenient to connect them directly. To solve this, I started exploring wireless solutions. I eventually purchased a NAD Wireless USB DAC 2, which, as the name suggests, was not only a wireless transmitter but also a DAC. This device used a more advanced protocol than Bluetooth, which is known for being lossy, so I thought it would be a suitable temporary solution. For about six months, the NAD Wireless USB DAC 2 served its purpose, allowing me to stream music wirelessly without compromising too much on sound quality. It was a convenient solution that bridged the gap between my laptop and amplifier. However, as with many of my audio components, the time came when I felt the need to move on and explore other options. While it wasn’t a permanent solution, it was a valuable learning experience in the realm of wireless audio.

        <h3>47 Laboratory OTA</h3>
        <p>
          The 47 Laboratory OTA cable was the first time I truly felt the impact that cables could have on sound quality. This cable is quite unique—a single 0.4mm (or 0.8mm for power cables) thick copper strand, encased in a slippery Teflon cover. When I rewired my system with the OTA cables, the difference was immediate and remarkable. I remember playing some electronic music that had always sounded a bit boomy with my system's basic cables. After switching to the OTA cables, the sound cleaned up dramatically, resulting in a more balanced and refined audio experience. This was a significant milestone for me. Up until then, I had been somewhat skeptical about the influence of audio cables, but this experience convinced me that they are worth the investment. One of the great things about the OTA cables is that they were relatively inexpensive, especially considering the impact they had. They were much cheaper than other cables on the market, making them a fantastic value for the improvement they brought to my system. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of selling them when I decided to upgrade. In hindsight, that wasn’t a wise decision, as these cables have become hard to find, and they were so affordable that I should have just held onto them—especially if I ever want to build a second system in the future. This experience taught me not just the importance of quality cables, but also the value of keeping certain components that can be difficult to replace.

        <h3>Neotech KS-1034M</h3>
        <p>
          The Neotech KS-1034M loudspeaker cable was my first foray into serious hi-fi accessories, marking a significant step in my audio journey. It occupied a unique price point—not outrageously expensive, but still substantial enough to cost half as much as my amplifier. At the time, this felt like a considerable investment, and I was quite proud to have it as part of my system. However, to be honest, I didn't notice much of a difference in sound quality after upgrading to this cable. This isn’t to say I’m skeptical about the impact of high-quality cables—quite the opposite. I firmly believe that well-made cables can influence sound quality, but I’ve come to realize that it requires a certain level of system refinement to truly appreciate these differences. Looking back, the Neotech KS-1034M was more of a symbolic purchase for me, representing my growing commitment to high-fidelity audio. It taught me an important lesson: while cables do matter, their impact becomes more noticeable as the rest of the system reaches higher levels of performance. So while this cable may not have revolutionized my listening experience at the time, it was a crucial step in my ongoing pursuit of better sound.
