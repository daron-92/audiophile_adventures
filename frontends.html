        <h3>Macbook Pro</h3>
        <p>
          Around 2015, I moved my hi-fi system to a smaller room and changed my digital front end. My previously used CyberHome DVD player, which had served me well, unfortunately broke down. I took it to the local repair shop, where the technician informed me that the laser had burnt out and the entire optical unit needed replacement. According to him, it wasn't worth repairing, but I still sometimes wonder if I made the right choice in abandoning the DVD player. After that, I turned to my 2012 MacBook Pro as my primary digital front end. I've been fortunate with this machine because, even after 10 years, it still serves me well. Initially, I used iTunes with my MP3 collection, which amounted to about 40 GB of music. Later, I transitioned to streaming. For a long time, I used Tidal's main app, appreciating its vast library and high-quality streams. Eventually, I paired Tidal with Roon, which offered a better overall user experience and allowed me to control it with my iPhone. However, I always encountered some connectivity issues, and the sound quality improvement wasn't as significant as I'd hoped. After two years with Roon, I decided to try Audirvana. It provided the best sound quality I had experienced so far, although its interface was a bit off-putting. Despite this, I was willing to overlook the less-than-ideal interface for the superior audio performance. Last year, I made another significant change: I began rebuilding my digital music library, but this time with lossless files. I switched the operating system on my MacBook to Linux Mint, as Apple had stopped providing updates for the old machine. This change greatly increased the laptop's responsiveness. For playback, I use Audacious on Linux Mint. The software is efficient and capable, especially considering the age of my MacBook. Rebuilding my music library with high-quality lossless files has been a rewarding experience, and I'm very satisfied with the capabilities of my current digital setup. This journey from a simple DVD player to a sophisticated high-resolution streaming setup has been filled with learning and growth, enhancing my appreciation for digital music.

        <h3>Rega Planar 3</h3>
        <p>
          After moving to another city, I didn't bother much with my hi-fi setup. The next significant upgrade was the Rega Planar 3. This was the first time I thought my turntable sounded truly enjoyable. Although listening to MP3s was still better, I gravitated towards the overall experience of vinyl. The Planar 3 was an evergreen hi-fi classic, a device I always wanted to own. Its simple, minimalistic build was pleasing to look at, and I found beauty in its rationality. Additionally, Regas are "hackable," especially the Planar 3, which had a strong DIY community behind it. This was good news for someone like me with a limited amount of money for the hobby. I made several modifications to the Planar 3 over the years. The most significant improvement was changing the basic mat for the Achromat II. I also upgraded the counterweight (off-center), the driving belt, the subplatter from Brazil, and a PSU secondhand from the UK. Each upgrade was worth it, although, in hindsight, I could have bought a Planar 6 with the money I spent. Nevertheless, the journey of tinkering and upgrading was more interesting. I got the Rega with the stock blue Elys cartridge, which I upgraded to the Goldring 1042—a match made in heaven for that tonearm. Later, I bought a Goldring Eroica, which taught me a valuable lesson: one bad move can ruin a fine stylus. During installation, I accidentally hit the tonearm with my hand and broke the stylus, so I never heard its sound. A Hungarian master repaired it for free, but it took a long time, and by the time it was ready, I had already moved on to my next turntable with another cartridge installed. The Rega Planar 3 marked a significant step in my hi-fi journey. It wasn't just about better sound quality but also about engaging with the vinyl community, exploring upgrades, and enjoying the tactile experience of playing records. This turntable made me appreciate the art of vinyl, setting a higher standard for my listening experience and fueling my passion for high-fidelity audio.

        <h3>NAD 5120</h3>
        <p>
          After a long period, I started looking for a better turntable. "Better" was a bit subjective in this case, as it's hard to tell if it was actually an upgrade, but after selling my Marantz turntable, I bought a NAD 5120—a somewhat legendary player from the '80s—in a computer shop. It was referred to as "the ugly duck" by the Hungarian hi-fi community following a review in HiFi Magazin. The flat-type tonearm looked really exotic, and the RCA cables were upgraded. The pickup, though I can't recall the type, was definitely an MM and was reputedly very good. However, the plastic cover didn't look very promising. After a few weeks, I removed the housing completely, which improved the sound slightly. However, my system was still too low-end to reveal differences in tonality or resolution. I think the weakest link in the chain was the DALI loudspeaker, which obscured any fine details and rendered my upgrade a bit unnecessary. But, to tell you the truth, I liked the NAD better than the Marantz. Despite its ugly look and somewhat cheap materials, the NAD had a soul that my previous turntable lacked. So, I still consider it a step up. The NAD 5120, with its quirks and unique design, felt like a turntable with character. It made my listening sessions more enjoyable, even if the overall system couldn't fully showcase its potential. This experience taught me that sometimes, the connection you feel with your equipment can be just as important as technical improvements.

        <h3>Marantz TT42P</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted a turntable for a long time, probably since I was about 8 years old. After setting up my CD and cassette systems, the next logical move was to get my hands on a turntable. I carefully chose the Marantz TT42P, a low-end but decent belt-driven, automatic device. I was happy with it for a few years. It allowed me to dive into the world of vinyl and appreciate its unique sound quality. However, I eventually got the itch to improve its stock Audio Technica pickup. Unfortunately, I discovered that I couldn't do this because the counterweight was fixed, so the stock pickup was the only one that fit. To add to my frustrations, the speed switcher eventually broke, preventing me from playing 45RPM vinyls that I owned. The Marantz TT42P was a good starting point, allowing me to explore vinyl and appreciate the medium's warmth and depth. However, after 3 or 4 years, I realized I needed to move on to something more versatile and reliable. This experience taught me valuable lessons about the importance of upgradeability and durability in audio equipment. Despite its limitations, the TT42P marked the beginning of my vinyl journey, and for that, I'll always remember it fondly.

        <h3>Denon DRW-695</h3>
        <p>
          I inherited more than 400 cassettes from my father, so getting a decent tape player was the logical next step. However, finding one wasn't easy. Cassettes had their glory days back in the '80s and '90s, and sourcing a good player in 2009 was challenging. It's even harder today, as manufacturers no longer produce cassette decks, making the secondhand market the only option where you have to hunt for deals. Despite the difficulty, I managed to get a Denon DRW-695 deck from an audiophile priest, although it came in a not-so-appealing gold color. Even though I have many cassettes, I rarely used the deck, and eventually, one of the sides became faulty. I put it in a box, and now it sits in the attic. I still plan to buy a high-end player someday, but it's still on my to-do list. This experience with cassette tapes has been a nostalgic journey, connecting me to my father's love for music. While I haven't used the Denon deck much, inheriting those tapes reminds me of the analog charm and the unique warmth that cassettes bring to music. One day, I hope to revive this part of my audio journey with a high-end player, allowing me to fully appreciate the collection that holds sentimental value.

        <h3>CyberHome CH-DVD 635</h3>
        <p>
          My first halfway decent digital front end was a CyberHome DVD player. Around 2008, this player was praised for its build quality, high-end appearance with a 16-segment display(?), and decent sound quality even from its analog output. Since I didn't have a DAC, I used it through its analog output and really liked that player.I can't say much about its sound quality because my speakers at the time were so poor that the whole system wasn't transparent enough to reveal the player's potential. Nevertheless, I was sad when the optical drive failed, and the repair shop couldn't do anything with it. The decline in popularity of DVD players became apparent as I struggled to find a better player at a reasonable price. Despite its eventual failure, the CyberHome DVD player holds a special place in my audio journey. It marked my first step towards a better digital front end and opened my eyes to the importance of quality in digital sources.
