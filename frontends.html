        <h3>Denon DRW-695</h3>
        <p>
          I inherited more than 400 cassettes from my father, so getting a decent tape player was the logical next step. However, finding one wasn't easy. Cassettes had their glory days back in the '80s and '90s, and sourcing a good player in 2009 was challenging. It's even harder today, as manufacturers no longer produce cassette decks, making the secondhand market the only option where you have to hunt for deals. Despite the difficulty, I managed to get a Denon DRW-695 deck from an audiophile priest, although it came in a not-so-appealing gold color. Even though I have many cassettes, I rarely used the deck, and eventually, one of the sides became faulty. I put it in a box, and now it sits in the attic. I still plan to buy a high-end player someday, but it's still on my to-do list. This experience with cassette tapes has been a nostalgic journey, connecting me to my father's love for music. While I haven't used the Denon deck much, inheriting those tapes reminds me of the analog charm and the unique warmth that cassettes bring to music. One day, I hope to revive this part of my audio journey with a high-end player, allowing me to fully appreciate the collection that holds sentimental value.

        <h3>CyberHome CH-DVD 635</h3>
        <p>
          My first halfway decent digital front end was a CyberHome DVD player. Around 2008, this player was praised for its build quality, high-end appearance with a 16-segment display(?), and decent sound quality even from its analog output. Since I didn't have a DAC, I used it through its analog output and really liked that player.I can't say much about its sound quality because my speakers at the time were so poor that the whole system wasn't transparent enough to reveal the player's potential. Nevertheless, I was sad when the optical drive failed, and the repair shop couldn't do anything with it. The decline in popularity of DVD players became apparent as I struggled to find a better player at a reasonable price. Despite its eventual failure, the CyberHome DVD player holds a special place in my audio journey. It marked my first step towards a better digital front end and opened my eyes to the importance of quality in digital sources.
