        <h3>CyberHome CH-DVD 635</h3>
        <p>
          My first halfway decent digital front end was a CyberHome DVD player. Around 2008, this player was praised for its build quality, high-end appearance with a 16-segment display(?), and decent sound quality even from its analog output. Since I didn't have a DAC, I used it through its analog output and really liked that player.I can't say much about its sound quality because my speakers at the time were so poor that the whole system wasn't transparent enough to reveal the player's potential. Nevertheless, I was sad when the optical drive failed, and the repair shop couldn't do anything with it. The decline in popularity of DVD players became apparent as I struggled to find a better player at a reasonable price. Despite its eventual failure, the CyberHome DVD player holds a special place in my audio journey. It marked my first step towards a better digital front end and opened my eyes to the importance of quality in digital sources.
